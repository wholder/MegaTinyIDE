SELFPRGEN:<b>Enable Self-Programming</b><br/>Provides a mechanism for downloading and uploading program code by the MCU itself.  This \
feature is normally used when implementing a bootloader.
RSTDISBL:<b>Disable External RESET Pin</b><br/>Warning - Enabling this fuse will disable the external RESET pin and prevent further programming \
of the chip using normal, In-Circuit programming and will require the use of a High Voltage Programmer, or Fuse Reset Programmer.
DWEN:<b>Enable DebugWIRE</b><br/>Warning - Enabling this fuse will disable further programming of the chip using \
normal, In-Circuit programming and will require the use of a High Voltage Programmer, or Fuse Reset Programmer.
SPIEN:<b>Enable In-Circuit Serial Program and Data Download</b><br/>Warning - Disabling this fuse will prevent further programming \
of the chip using normal In-Circuit programming and will require the use of a High Voltage Programmer, or Fuse Reset Programmer.
WDTON:<b>Set Watchdog Timer Always On</b><br/>If programmed, this fuse forces the Watchdog Timer to System Reset mode. With the fuse \
programmed and the WDE bit and WDIE bit are locked to 1 and 0 respectively.
EESAVE:<b>Preserve EEPROM on Chip Erase</b><br/>when this fuse is set, the contents of the EEPROM will not be erased when new code is \
programmed into the Flash memory.
BODLEVEL:<b>Set On-chip Brown-out Detection (BOD) Voltage</b><br/>The On-chip Brown-out Detection (BOD) circuit for monitors the VCC level \
during operation by comparing it to a fixed trigger level. The trigger level for the BOD can be selected by the BODLEVEL Fuses. \
When the BOD is enabled, and VCC decreases to a value below the trigger level, the Brown-out Reset is immediately activated.
CKDIV8:<b>Clock Divided by 8</b><br/>Set the processor to run at 1/8 the speed of the system oscillator.
CKOUT:<b>Enable Clock Output</b><br/>When this fuse is enabled the system clock is putput on the CLKO pin.
SUT:<b>Sets Start-up Time Delay</b><br/>Note: the effect of these fuses varies depending upon the value selected for the CKSEL fuses.
CKSEL:<b>Selects Clock Source</b><br/>The CKSEL, in combination with the SUT fuses, select the source of the system clock as well as \
the startup delay after power on, or reset.  <b>Warning</b>: some settings, such as selecting an external oscillaor as the clock source \
when no is present can disable further programming of the chip.
PREPROCESS:<b>Enable Preprocessor Menu</b><br/>When enabled, a new menu option named "Run Preprocessor" is added to the "Actions" Menu. \
This develeoper feature can be used to run the source code through the C++ Preprocessor and then through the automatic prototype \
generator code and then display the result in the Listings pane.
GEN_PROTOS:<b>Enable Automatic Prototype Generation</b><br/>When this experimental feature enabled, the "Build" operation attempts to \
automatically generate function prototypes for all functions in the main source file before running the compiler.
DEV_ONLY:<b>Enable Developer-Only Features</b><br/>When enabled, some otherwise hidden features used to test code are made available.
UPDI_DECODE:<b>Enable UPDI Decoding</b><br/>When enabled, UPDI messages are decoded to Info Pane.  You must restart MegaTinyIDE before it will take effect.
SHOW_DEPENDENCIES:<b>Shoes Dependencies</b><br/>When enabled, shows what files preprocessor identifies as included files.
ENABLE_PROJECTS: <b>Enable Project Folders</b><br/>When enabled, allows creation of project folders that can contain multiple source files.
INTERLEAVE:<b>Interleave Code</b><br/>When enabled, display source code intermixed with disassembly
SYMTABLE:<b>Symbol Table</b><br/>When enabled, include symbol table in listing
VECNAMES:<b>Vector Names</b><br/>When enabled, add Vector Names in listing
PROGBAUD:Serial Programmer Baud Rate
