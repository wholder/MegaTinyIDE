MegaTinyIDE is a simple, GNU-based IDE that's derived from another project of mine called ATTiny10IDE, which I originally wrote to simplify writing code for the ATTiny10 Series Microcontrollers using C. C++ or Assembly language.  This new version is intended to support coding for the new MegaTiny chips (tinyAVRÂ® 1-series and 0-series), such as the ATtiny212, which feature a greatly expanded set of features compared to the original, Atmel-designed ATTiny series chips.

## Credit and Thanks

This project would have been much harder and much less cool without help from the following open source projects, or freely available software.

 - [Hid4Java](https://github.com/gary-rowe/hid4java) by Gary Rowe (used to talk to USB-based programmers)
 - [ATTinyCore](https://github.com/SpenceKonde/ATTinyCore) library by Spence Konde (aka Dr. Azzy)
 - [JSyntaxPane](https://github.com/nordfalk/jsyntaxpane) - Now uses [CppSyntaxPane](https://github.com/wholder/CppSyntaxPane), which is based on JSyntaxPane.
 - [GraphPaperLayout](http://www.iitk.ac.in/esc101/05Aug/tutorial/uiswing/layout/example-1dot4/GraphPaperLayout.java) by Michael Martak, a grid layout manager that supports row and column spanning
 - [IntelliJ IDEA from JetBrains](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/) (my favorite development environment for Java coding. Thanks JetBrains!)
 - [ANTLR version 4.7.1](http://www.antlr.org) - ALTLRv4 was used to generate the parser for the new (experimental) automatic prototype type generation feature.
 - [CPP14 Antlr Grammar](https://github.com/antlr/grammars-v4/blob/master/cpp/CPP14.g4) - CPP14 was used as the base, C++ grammar for the automatic prototype type generation feature.
